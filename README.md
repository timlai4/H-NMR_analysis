# H-NMR_analysis

## Overview

In this repo, we have a dataset of 750 molecules, each described by 471 numerical features derived from Hydrogen-NMR (H-NMR) spectroscopy. 
The dataset also includes two molecular permeability endpoints: 
- `Perm_B_A_ratio` 
- `Perm_B_A` 

I develop a computational model that predicts one of these permeability endpoints using the H-NMR data. 
In doing so, I applied best practices in data science, including preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and documentation.

The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) includes:
- Clear sections and annotations
- Explanation of my workflow and reasoning
- Code used for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- A conclusion describing how to monitor and maintain model performance over time using additional data
